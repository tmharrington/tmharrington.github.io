Undergraduate repository containing  RStudio workbooks created in Bioinformatics BIO-4ST1-14708

This page will contain three Rstudio projects in order of my progress using coding tools. Palmer_penguine dataset was used to initially understand how to utilize RStudio for data cleaning and analysis. Invertebrates was an attempt to first explore a unknown dataset that was less-then-friendly for a new coder to manipulate and interpret. 
The most significant piece of work contained in this page is the analysis of indoor pollution representing a percentage of deaths in countries across the globe.
