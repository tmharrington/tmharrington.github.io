# tmharrington.github.io
Undergraduate repository containing  RStudio workbooks created in Bioinformatics BIO-4ST1-14708

This page will contain three Rstudio projects in order of my progress using coding tools. Palmer_penguine dataset was used to initially understand how to utilize RStudio for data cleaning and analysis. Invertebrates was an attempt to first explore a unknown dataset that was less-then-friendly for a new coder to manipulate and interpret. 
The most significant piece of work contained in this page is the analysis of indoor pollution representing a percentage of deaths in countries across the globe.

## Statistical Analysis: Basic Functions

## Introduction
  This journal contains some useful examples of how to run basic statistics functions using the base RStudio software. These workbook have been developed over the first half of ENV 220 Field Methods and Technologies. The methods of statistical analysis that are described in this section include functions for linear regression, t-testing and ANOVA testing. These resources are valuable for understanding the coding and statistical formulas that can be used in RStudio to make inferential statements from a dataset.
